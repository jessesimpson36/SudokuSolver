# SudokuSolver

This is a command line tool that solves basic sudoku puzzles by checking every box if it can be solved repetitively.
My goal was to solve the puzzles without any sort of brute force method or backtracking algorithm. The end result is
it can solve basic to some intermediate puzzles, but not advanced level.
